# vAlgo
vAlgo - Vigilant Algorithm. <br>
Is my latest Machine Learning passion project. <br>
I will be creating different ML tools under the vAlgo name.
<br>
This will be an on-going passion project.
<br><br>
# vAlgo : Malicious URLs Model.
<br>
The Dataset URL: http://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/projects/url/ 
<br>
Taking inspiration from the work being done by UC San Diago, I have downloaded the SVM Light dataset, and have been working with it to create an ML Model that can learn and detect Malicious URLs. 
<br>
I will be writing about my process and progress on my blog. <br>
